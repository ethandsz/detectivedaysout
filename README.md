# detectivedaysout

"From May till September 2022 Detective Days Out are coming to Cambridge.
We aim to attract local history and detective lovers, as well as those who are after family-friendly events in the open air, from Cambridge and beyond.
The programme of a Detective Day Out includes an interactive adventure Murder Mystery Game on the streets of the city during the day and theatre performance at a landmark venue in the evening.
Local volunteers are at the heart of making this project. In collaboration with the Cambridge City Council, social and arts centres, we will provide professional training to 30 volunteers - Game Masters, Front of House staff and Technicians. We want to reach out to disadvantaged Cambridge residents to address barriers to arts activities, help boost self-confidence and develop interpersonal skills as part of a creative team."
