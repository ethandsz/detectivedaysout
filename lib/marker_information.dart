        '''This Cambridge college created for women in the Victorian era has its dark pages. In 1913-1914 the society was shaken by a series of tragic incidents that caused deaths of three students. The management of the college was trying for cover for these cases in an attempt to observe the vulnerable reputation of this unique institution. Although one of the students, a bright young Polish girl Anastazia P., who was supposed to become the fourth victim in this chain of deaths, managed to survive and told the truth to the police. The investigation started, and awful facts were revealed. Police figured out that behind at least one suicide and two tragic accidents that happened on the college territory stood a 45yo guest professor of Archaeology. The killer was cornered, although committed suicide to avoid punishment.

There was a complete skeleton of a woman buried alive, her jaws opened in a terrible silent scream. Also, there was a skeleton of a dead shrew in the coffin, who clearly was feeding on the woman. Roman customs were burying alive of various types of criminals with live animals according to their crimes. Shrew whose bite is poisonous would be buried with a poisoner. But the patricides suffered the worst punishments: they were buried with a live monkey and a snake. People say that since the sarcophagus has been discovered, the ancient curse by the dead Roman woman was put on the house whose owners troubled her peace.''');

Few very last months of its presence in the old building were overshadowed by a scandal with two doctors losing their licenses due to bad mistakes that cost the lives of their patients. A 50yo patient walked in the A & E department three times suffering bad headaches and was prescribed painkillers. In a few hours after his third visit he was taken by ambulance to intensive care where he died of an extensive stroke. Another 32yo woman was delivered to the hospital after a suicidal attempt, although the doctor decided that there was no need in further psychiatric survey and sent her home. The woman has committed suicide in a couple of days. Both doctors lost their licenses, and the hospital introduced a new protocol of medical decision making.''');

Shortly before her death she has been attended to Addenbrookes Hospital after a suicidal attempt, but after a brief examination and wound treatment (she tried to cut her veins) she’s been sent home. Seems like her brain condition was much worse than the doctor considered, she was determined to end her life and the second attempt was successful. Sadly, she was a mother of a 11yo son and a loving wife. Her family was left broken hearted. The doctor who missed her condition and made the crucial mistake sending her home got under investigation and lost his professional license.

A 22 yo American postgraduate student Sarah Thompson was found dead on the Trinity lane, near her college Gonville and Caius. A deadly dose of insulin was found in her blood, which caused her death. Sarah has never been prescribed with insulin, so the case was classified as a murder. The US Embassy took the case under tight control, and a long and uneasy discussion about how to maintain the international students’ safety in Cambridge took place. Police questioned all the people who knew Sarah, including her university mentors and classmates, but no accusation was indicted. Sarah was doing MA in British Roman Archaeology and was described as a talented and prominent scientist.  ''');

The boy’s body was never found.
